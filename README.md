AFRTK-G

Advanced Face Recognition System using Tkinter GUI. This project is built using the Python language. 

Some of the features are given below:-

  It has an attendance management system.
  It has a student management system.
  It has a face recognition system with in-time training data features.
  It also has a chatbot system for Help and queries.
  It has a multiclass login feature where students, teachers, and admin can log in.
  It has an automatic email sender feature used when a teacher has to login.
Let's say if someone forgets his/her password, there is also a "forgot password" feature. The Students can register themselves by clicking on the register button.

In this project, the Teachers can register only if the admin allows him/her to register, once the teachers preregister, they are sent a private key in their respective emails.

I have provided the tables used in the database under the name Database folder.
